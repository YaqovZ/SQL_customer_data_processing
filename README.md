# Sales Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data for a scale model car store using SQLite and DB Browser. The primary aim is to extract key performance indicators (KPIs) for strategic decision-making in inventory management, marketing, and customer acquisition.

## Key Features
- **Database Tool**: Utilizes DB Browser for SQLite for querying and manipulating the sales database.
- **Data Analysis**: Targets sales data to derive actionable insights.
- **Questions Addressed**:
  1. Inventory decisions based on product performance.
  2. Marketing strategies tailored to customer behaviors.
  3. Budget allocation for new customer acquisition.

## Database Structure
Includes eight tables: Customers, Employees, Offices, Orders, OrderDetails, Payments, Products, and ProductLines.

## Analysis Insights
- **Inventory Management**: Identification of high-demand products for restocking, like classic cars.
- **Marketing Strategies**: Categorization of customers into VIPs and less engaged, facilitating targeted marketing approaches.
- **Customer Acquisition**: Computation of Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) to inform the budget for new customer acquisition.

## Conclusion
The project successfully identifies:
- Priority products for restocking, such as various classic car models.
- Key customer segments for targeted marketing strategies.
- A calculated LTV to guide customer acquisition spending.

## Project Summary

Inventory Management:
- Focus on restocking classic cars, including specific models like 1952 Alpine Renault 1300, 1968 Ford Mustang, etc.
- These products show high sales performance and are crucial for our inventory.

Marketing Strategies:
- VIP customers like Diego Freyre and Susan Nelson contribute significantly to profits.
- Tailored marketing strategies are recommended for VIPs to maintain loyalty.
- Least engaged customers, including Mary Young and Leslie Taylor, offer potential for increased engagement.
- Targeted marketing could transform them into more profitable customers.

Customer Acquisition Budget:
- LTV analysis suggests an average profit of $39,039.59 per customer.
- This figure guides our budget for new customer acquisition strategies.
